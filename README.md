# Capstone-1 Proposal

###  1. Analysis of a brand of a car (e.g. Ford) price from CarMax or any other website and perform statistical analysis on the data 

The analysis would help in evaluating/comparing the impact of car features on car price. 

###  2. Analysis of the price competivieness from Amazon/Ebay/Walmart and perform statistical analysis on the data

The analysis would help in comparing the price of products (e.g, laptops) and determine if 
there is significat differnce in the mean price or not.

###  3. Analysis of yelp/google review of Austin restaurants and perform statistical analysis the data

The result would answer several questions such as the popularity of food (e.g, Mexican vs. seafood).
    


#### Note: We can use different statistical analysis methods such as hypothesis testing and bayesian hypothesis testing for the proposed topics.
